# Pradip's Greasemonkey Scripts
Some of greasemonkey scripts I have made in last few years.

## Scripts ##
- `DeviantArt_-_Download_All.user.js` Launchs download for all items in current DeviantArt page including search results. Select *Download All Art* from Greasemonkey UserScript Commands menu.
- `html5_video_downloader_a.user.js` Tries to block HTML5 videos everywhere. Puts download and unblocking links in middle of video. Works on majority of sites.
- `ImgUr_-_Direct_Image.user.js` Redirects to direct image on ImgUr, QuickMeme and Gyazo. Avoids redirecting in albums with multiple images.
- `Reddit_-_Highlight_Most_Voted.user.js` Highlights comments on Reddit by upvotes/downvotes.
- `Reddit_-_Sort_Submissions.user.js` Sorts comments and posts on Reddit by votes, hotness, depth, drama, child comments, post type or time. Sorting can be slower on ~500 comments, avoid browser warning.
- `Reddit_Links_Table.user.js` Generates link table from comments on Reddit. Select *Generate Links Table* from Greasemonkey UserScript Commands menu.
- `Reddit_Tracker.user.js` Allows user tracking posts and comments and see updates (i.e. number of votes and comments change) when visited again. Select *Track posts in this page* from Greasemonkey UserScript Commands menu.
- `Serif_Font_for_Articles.user.js` Analyzes page content, sets default Serif font to possible articles, stories, etc. Allows setting minimum font size from UserScript Commands menu.
- `Sort_Tables.user.js` Any table on any page can be sorted. Hold shift and click on first row of table to sort. Hold Ctrl with Shift to include header in sorting.
- `YouTube_Real_Thumbnails.user.js` Replaces video thumbnails on YouTube with real thumbnail. Thumbnail represents image from video and it's lower quality.
